# SOCIALNETWORK
TITLE- SOCIAL NETWORKING ANALYSIS

This Social Networking Analysis project is implemented in C++ and provides a comprehensive system for social networking functionalities. Users can create profiles, connect with others, manage posts, and explore mutual connections efficiently.

Tech Stack
C++: The core programming language used for implementing the project.
File Handling: Used for storing user profiles and posts persistently.
Graph Representation: Utilizes graph structures to manage user connections.
Linked List: Dynamic data structure for efficient post management.
DFS Algorithm: Employed for finding mutual paths between user profiles.

HOW TO RUN:
Copy the entire C++ code from the provided source.
Open your C++ compiler. You can use popular compilers like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or any online C++ compiler.

FUTURE SCOPE
Advanced Graph Analysis: Explore and implement advanced graph algorithms for more in-depth social network analysis.
Enhanced Security Measures: Integrate additional security features to enhance user authentication and data protection
